Hi!

This simple Python program helps you identify which country a Chartered Diplomat's (CD) number plate belongs to. The numbering system is based on the order in which each country recognized our independence.

Lots to fix up and plenty of potential to iterate into a much cooler app, perhaps something web-based for faster searching on-the-go for example.

But here's a simple Version 1 for now.

Enjoy!
